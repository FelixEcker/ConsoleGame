General Todo:
	- Balance Troops
	- Implement Troop actions

Multiplayer:
	- Text messages send as ids (e.g. "troop.attack.used")
		- Sent as CLST, id is first entry. If the corresponding
		  message should be a format string, the strings are
		  also in the CLST.
			("some.msg.with.formats;format string one;format string two;")
	- For Map updates sends a single "Map" object containing the maps of terrain, control points and troops
	- Commands sent as numbers (nextTurn -> 0x00 etc.)

Computer Enemy:
	- Target Priorities: Capture Point, Troop of largest threat (which has a chance to be defeated), Medic, All Other Troops (Weaksted->Strongest)
	- Capture Point Priority: 1. Unowned, 2. Player
	- Always prefers next capture point, regardless of owner
	- If an Unowned Point is nearer than a player owned point, go for that.

Goal (?): Territory Control
	- Capture n Points across the map
	- First player to capture all points wins
	- Troops can only be deployed to captured points

Capture Points:
	- Can defend themselves
		- Meaning that if attacked, they have a defense turn
		- They can also once per round attack nearby enemy troups
	- If Health is at 0% and Defense below 5%, they can be captured
	- Capturing restores health to 30%, then they have to be repaired
	- Repairing takes multiple turns (automatic)
		- Defense:
			- Repairing after Capture is 20% per round
			- After defense restored for 1st time repair rate becomes 10%
		- Core:
			- Repairingis 15% per round
			- After 85% is reached repair rate is 7.5%
	- Have 2 Sets of health
		1. Defense
		2. Core
	- Once Defense Health is below 85% damage gets split 25% & 75% between core and defense
	- Defense Health replaces damage absorption
	- Attack/Defense radius of 2 fields
	- NOTE FOR ATTACKING CAPTURE POINTS: Attacking a CP should never capture them, 
	  to capture one, the "capture" action is to be used, which can intern attack
          a capture point.
	- Capture Points can deploy Troops
		- No Idea yet for what you need to deploy a troop or how much of it for different types
    - Each Capture Point has 4 factories, these are in charge of repairing the CP's defenses and healing it.
        - Deploying of a Troop also takes up 1 factory per troop for a different amount of Rounds set by the
          troop.
