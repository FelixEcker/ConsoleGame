Goal (?): Territory Control
	- Capture n Points across the map
	- First player to capture all points wins
	- Troops can only be deployed to captured points

Capture Points:
	- Can defend themselves
		- Meaning that if attacked, they have a defense turn
		- They can also once per round attack nearby enemy troups
	- If Health is at 0% and Defense below 5%, they can be captured
	- Capturing restores health to 30%, then they have to be repaired
	- Repairing takes multiple turns (automatic)
	- Have 2 Sets of health
		1. Defense
		2. Core
	- Once Defense Health is below 85% damage gets split 25% & 75% between core and defense
	- Defense Health replaces damage absorption
	- Attack/Defense radius of 2 fields
	- NOTE FOR ATTACKING CAPTURE POINTS: Attacking a CP should never capture them, 
	  to capture one, the "capture" action is to be used, which can intern attack
          a capture point.
