Scrap file for Game Ideas & Bugs (Crappy design doc)

General Todo:
	- Implement Automatic defense repair
	- Implement checking for player wins after one player finishes turn
	- Implement Enemy "AI"
	- Maybe (really maybe, if I end up liking the game) Implement server for multiplayer
		- Thats gonna be a seperate branch, cant be bothered to restructure the entire code
		  to support Single & Multiplayer in one executable

Multiplayer:
	- Text messages send as ids (e.g. "troop.attack.used")
		- Sent as CLST, id is first entry. If the corresponding
		  message should be a format string, the strings are
		  also in the CLST.
			("some.msg.with.formats;format string one;format string two;")
	- For Map updates sends a single "Map" object containing the maps of terrain, control points and troops
	- Commands sent as numbers (nextTurn -> 0x00 etc.)

Goal (?): Territory Control
	- Capture n Points across the map
	- First player to capture all points wins
	- Troops can only be deployed to captured points

Capture Points:
	- Can defend themselves
		- Meaning that if attacked, they have a defense turn
		- They can also once per round attack nearby enemy troups
	- If Health is at 0% and Defense below 5%, they can be captured
	- Capturing restores health to 30%, then they have to be repaired
	- Repairing takes multiple turns (automatic)
		- Defense:
			- Repairing after Capture is 20% per round
			- After defense restored for 1st time repair rate becomes 10%
		- Core:
			- Repairingis 15% per round
			- After 85% is reached repair rate is 7.5%
	- Have 2 Sets of health
		1. Defense
		2. Core
	- Once Defense Health is below 85% damage gets split 25% & 75% between core and defense
	- Defense Health replaces damage absorption
	- Attack/Defense radius of 2 fields
	- NOTE FOR ATTACKING CAPTURE POINTS: Attacking a CP should never capture them, 
	  to capture one, the "capture" action is to be used, which can intern attack
          a capture point.
	- Capture Points can deploy Troops
		- No Idea yet for what you need to deploy a troop or how much of it for different types
